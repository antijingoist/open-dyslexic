Download latest version of the font by clicking [here](https://github.com/antijingoist/open-dyslexic/raw/master/opendyslexic.ttf).

The latest version may not always be the best version. If you want a stable version, check http://dyslexicfonts.com/downloads.php or http://dafont.com/open-dyslexic.font for a stable.

If you are upgrading your copy of this font, you may want to remove previous version first. 
Also, the naming convention will now be "opendyslexic" and "opendyslexic-[style]."

See what it looks like in the screenshots on http://dyslexicfonts.com

font to help readability, and help dyslexic readability.

Your brain can sometimes do funny things to letters. OpenDyslexic tries to help prevent some of these things from happening. Letters have heavy weighted bottoms to add a kind of "gravity" to each letter, helping to keep your brain from rotating them around in ways that can make them look like other letters. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help reenforce the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter can help prevent flipping and swapping.

OpenDyslexic also takes a different approach to italic styles. It is generally recommended that italics be avoided in reading material for dyslexia. However, instead of taking the normal approach of "slant x% for italic," OpenDyslexic's italic style has been crafted to allow for it's use for emphasis while maintaining readability.

Rules:

- similar letters must look different
- make the letters have some weight to them, so that confusable letters have an obvious rotation.
- Intent to be used as 'the' on screen UI font is in my head also.

You guys are super cool! Thanks!

It is based on Bitstream Vera Sans because of the nice license it has. 

If you are looking for the source file, it is the .ttf file. Also, I am not packaging this as an EXE file.

You should not have downloaded this as an exe: You may get spyware. :( If you were compelled to pay for this font, ask for a refund. This font is provided at no charge. Donations are cool though. :)

Places I've officially uploaded the latest stable versions to are dafont.com and http://dyslexicfonts.com
